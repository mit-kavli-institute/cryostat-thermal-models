# cryostat-thermal-models
Python toolkit for simple thermal modeling of cryogenic systems. 

# Set Up and Install:
Instructions can be found in [setup.md](setup.md)

# Usage:
Example notebooks are found in [examples](examples). Start with the 3-stage sample model: [3-stage example model](examples/example_thermal_model_3stage.ipynb) which describes a simple 3-stage cryostat with some basic wiring and solves for the middle stage temperate assuming fixed inner and outer temperatures. More complex examples are forthcoming.
